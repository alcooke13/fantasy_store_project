Fantasy store inventory

Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers.

Be able to edit product and manufacturer page, add more items/manufacturers to the page.
    Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view. *
    When a product is clicked goes to a page to show product category list the subcategories inside. Click an item which shows more details about that single product on the page *
	
As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user. *

Possible Extensions

•	Filter the inventory list by manufacturer. For example, provide an option to view all books in stock by a certain author.
-	Filter by the categories of the products showing only all the weapons/potions/etc *
